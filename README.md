### Development

09/01/2023 - I have spent the last couple of weeks setting up a PostgreSQL database and linked it with the project. Now all the user data, information about medals and which timestables have been learned are saved securely via bit.io.  

Here is an overview on how the data is saved in the SQL database and how it is accessed by the app.
