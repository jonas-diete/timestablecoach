# Times Table Coach

This is a web app that teaches children their multiplication tables.
I developed this app myself in late 2021 and have been revisiting it after finishing my Makers Academy Coding bootcamp.
I am currently refactoring some functions to improve the code quality

### Tech Used

- Python
- Flask
- PostgreSQL
- JavaScript

### Development

09/01/2023 - I have spent the last couple of weeks setting up a PostgreSQL database and linked it with the project. Now all the user data, information about medals and which timestables have been learned are saved securely via bit.io.  

Here is an overview on how the data is saved in the SQL database and how it is accessed by the app.
